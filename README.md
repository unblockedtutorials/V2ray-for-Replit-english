# Instructions:
<p>After clicking the Run button at the top, the service will run automatically. Then copy the VMess/VLess protocol link in the console window and import it into the client software. Or use mobile client software to scan the QR code of the VMess/VLess protocol. </p>

<p><b>UUID (User ID) or disguised path in custom node:</b></p>
<p>Since UUID uses the REPL_ID variable provided by the Replit platform by default, each instance UUID is unique and will not be known to others, and there will be no node information leakage problem. Therefore, customizing information such as UUID is of little significance. If you really want to make changes, please refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Use a third-party tool (https://www.v2fly.org/awesome/tools.html) to generate a new UUID. </p>
<p>2. Click the Secrets button in the Tools menu on the left. Add three system variables. The key values â€‹â€‹are</p>
"UUID", "VMESS_WSPATH" and "VLESS_WSPATH". </p>
The value values â€‹â€‹are "UUID generated using third-party tools", "vmess camouflage path" and "vless camouflage path". </p>
<p>3. Note: The values â€‹â€‹of "VMESS_WSPATH" and "VLESS_WSPATH" need to start with the "/" symbol. </p>
